# GenomicsScripts
Scripts used by Alex Sotola, currently a postdoc at the University of Georiga in the Department of Genetics, for processing and analyzing sequence data. Generally, these are bash scripts that call programs, Perl or Python scripts to processes these complex data. 

Disclaimer: These scripts are fluid, change over time, and can be user/system specific, it is up to the user to read through and edit/change as needed by their cluster system. Of course, happy to help edit or make changes/suggestions!
