# GenomicsScripts
Scripts used by Alex Sotola, currently a postdoc at the University of Georiga in the Department of Genetics, for processing and analyzing sequence data. 

Disclaimer: These scripts are fluid and change over time, it is up to the user to read through and edit/change as needed by their cluster system. Of course, happy to help edit or make changes/suggestions!
